Making a local change?

PS this is weird

This is a remote change that I made from the github website via the pencil icon.

I am going to make a local change that will conflict with the remote change that happened simultaneously with this change that are not the same. 


:P
This is gonna make a mess here because this is my remote change to the code. 

Now it is all better :)
